Christmas in the Country by Thomas Rhett

christmas in the country

Man, I sure do love this time of year
Snow starts covering up the old John Deere
Old school lights hanging off the roof
Front porch mistletoe kissing booth
Cup filled up with some feel-good Christmas cheer
'Round here
We got snowflakes falling on an old true lane
Red-bow wreaths on a window pane
Just sitting 'round a fire with the ones who love me
Miles from a city and the crazy crowds
Where the pine trees grow and the world slows down
Way out here, yeah, man I sure feel lucky
Doing Christmas in the country (do-do, do-do, do-do)
Doing Christmas in the country (do-do, do-do, do-do)
Up right piano in the living room
Sing "Silent Night" just a little out of tune
Christmas vacation on the TV screen
Wise man missing from the manger scene
Kids can't sleep 'cause Santa's coming soon, yeah real soon
We got snowflakes falling on an old true lane
Red-bow wreaths on a window pane
Just sitting 'round a fire with the ones who love me
Miles from a city and the crazy crowds
Where the pine trees grow and the world slows down
Way out here, yeah, man I sure feel lucky
Doing Christmas in the country (do-do, do-do, do-do)
Doing Christmas in the country (do-do, do-do, do-do)
We got a tree, goes up to the ceiling
Chop up wood and go get the candles
Sled down the hill, we'll get the 4-wheeler
And take you back up to the top
You could be 10 miles away
And see my house from the road
Man, we got it all decked out
Lord, I can't wait to get home
And see snowflakes falling on an old true lane
Frontyard Santa with a reindeer sleigh
Just sitting 'round a fire with the ones who love me
Miles from a city and the crazy crowds
Where the pine trees grow and the world slows down
Way out here, yeah, man I sure feel lucky
Doing Christmas in the country (do-do, do-do, do-do)
Doing Christmas in the country, oh yeah (do-do, do-do, do-do)
Doing Christmas in the country (do-do, do-do, do-do)
Christmas in the country (do-do, do-do, do-do)
