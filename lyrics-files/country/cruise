Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey, baby
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, oh, good Lord, she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs
Through the middle every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Huh, so baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck"
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs
Through the middle every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Huh, so baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
Then I turned on those KC lights
And drove all night 'cause it felt so right
Her and I, man, we feel so right
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords and sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs
Through the middle every little farm town with you
Well, baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs
Through the middle every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
Come on
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aw, yeah
