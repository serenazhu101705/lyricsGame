Every Little Thing by Russell Dickerson

yours

My baby, she's Alabama, my Dixieland delight
Kissin' me like molasses, slow and sweet, mm-hm, just right
She's an endless August summer, yeah, sunshine 3-6-5
When she forgets the punch line, it still gets me every time
'Cause I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
I'm all hung up, 'cause I love
Every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Yeah, she's Seattle and Sonoma, runs on coffee and red wine
She's easy like Sunday morning and wild like Saturday night
She's 24-carat goodness, an angel's all I see
She dresses up for everything, but she only dress down for me
And I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
I'm all hung up, 'cause I love
Every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Yeah! Woo!
Come on!
Hey, hey!
Yeah!
My baby, she's Alabama, my Dixieland delight
She's everybody's dream girl, but she's all mine
And I love every little, every little, every little thing about her love
Just a little, just a little, just a little ain't enough
Gotta get a, gotta get a, get a little more of all she does
I'm all hung up, 'cause I love
Every little, every little, every little thing about her love, oh
About her love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo! Hey, hey!
'Bout her love
