Hard to Forget by Sam Hunt

hard to forget

There stands the glass
That will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain
It's my first one today
There stands the glass
That-that will ease all my pain
That-that will settle my brain
It's-it's my first one today
Hey
I saw your sister at work
I saw your mama at church
I'm pretty sure I saw your car at the mall
I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call
It's kinda funny how I can't seem to get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight in that dress
Just to mess with my head
So much for so long, out of sight, out of mind
Girl you're looking so good, it's driving me out of mine
Aw, you're breaking my heart
Baby, you're playing hard to forget
Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch on the swing
You'd come and grab them by the end of the week
It's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been dragging your feet
Ain't it funny how I can't seem to get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight in that dress
Just to mess with my head
So much for so long, out of sight, out of mind
Girl you're looking so good, it's driving me out of mine
Aw, you're breaking my heart
Baby, you're playing hard to forget
There stands the glass
That-that will ease all my pain
That-that will settle my brain
It's-it's my first one today
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight in that dress
Just to mess with my head
So much for so long, out of sight, out of mind
Girl you're looking so good, it's driving me out of mine
Aw, you're breaking my heart
Baby, you're playing hard to forget
Aw honey, I'm falling apart
You're playing hard to forget
