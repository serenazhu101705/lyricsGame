I Should Probably Go to Bed by Dan and Shay
Dan and Shay
i should probably go to bed

All my friends finally convinced
Me to get out of the house
To help me forget, to help me move on
Then I heard you're back in town
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me that you were coming, so
I should probably go to bed
I should probably turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead
I should probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the morning (in the morning)
I'll be calling (I'll be calling)
Saying sorry for the things I said, so
I, yeah, I should probably go to bed
So I don't undo the got over you
That it took so long to find
'Cause all it would take is seeing your face
and I'll forget
I should probably go to bed
I should probably turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead
I should probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the morning (in the morning)
I'll be calling (I'll be calling)
Saying sorry for the things I said, so
I, yeah, I should probably go to bed
Before I question my decision
Is it love? I know it isn't
Now I'm all up in my head again
'Cause I know don't have, the self-control
To walk away if you walk in
Oh
I know, I know, I know, I know
I should probably go to bed
Ooh-ah, I'm all up in my head again (I'm all up in my head again)
Ooh-ah, I should probably go to bed (go to bed)
Ooh-ah, I'm all up in my head (go to bed, go to bed, go to bed)
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me that you were coming, so
I should probably go to bed
