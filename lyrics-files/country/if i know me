If I Know Me by Morgan Wallen

if i know me

They say you need a couple credits 'fore they'll let you out of college
I bet you bought that beer with your daddy's card
You're looking like you probably get a little tired of all this
Attention that you're getting when you go to the bar
We can take a different route
I know you're from a different town
But you're here for now
So whatcha say we get on out and see where this night leads?
If I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Then I take you home you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a-quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommates home
Honey, when the sun come peaking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
If I know me
If I know me
This ain't some routine that I use every Friday
This ain't a one line, one night kiss and tell
But ever since I caught you looking over my way
All that I could do was tell myself
If I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Then I take you home you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a-quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommates home
Honey, when the sun come peaking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
If I know me, if I know me
And I could just change my mind and leave my number in your phone
And give you a kiss goodnight and go home alone
But if I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Then I take you home you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a-quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommates home
Honey, when the sun come peaking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
If I know me
