life changes

Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anyone else would like 'em
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear god laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
I bought a ring and she said "I do"
But everybody else said, "man, you're twenty-two
"Whatcha trying to prove?"
"Hey why don't you wait?"
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand and now everybody wanna die a happy man
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you god laughing
Life changes (yes it does) and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama you're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen
Well I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A bigger wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we'd had
Now there's Willa, and sweet Ada James
Yeah that's two under two, hey, what can I say?
Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes (yes it does) and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
The world, the world
The world, the world
