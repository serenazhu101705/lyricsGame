You say it every day now
I know I get spaced out
In a conversation
Yeah, it's been a hard year
You say that I don't hear
All the words you're saying
And it makes you miss me
Even when you're with me
Feels like something's broken
I know I've been acting
Easily distracted
You wish I could focus
You think that I don't notice
How you brush your hair out of your green eyes
The way you blush when you drink red wine
The way you smile when you try to bend the truth
You think that I don't notice
All the songs you sing underneath your breath
You still tear up at a beach sunset
And you dance just like you're the only the in the room
You think that I don't notice, but I do
I do, yeah, I do, yeah
At that party last night
Baby, I don't know why
I forgot to mention
You were looking drop-dead
Not even a contest
Center of attention
If I had to say every time you looked amazing
You'd think I was joking
But I brag about you
When I'm not around you
You don't even know it
You think that I don't notice
How you brush your hair out of your green eyes
The way you blush when you drink red wine
The way you smile when you try to bend the truth
You think that I don't notice
All the songs you sing underneath your breath
You still tear up at a beach sunset
And you dance just like you're the only the in the room
You think that I don't notice, but I
See it all, and I keep on falling for you every night
Over and over again
it's my fault that I don't remind you every day of your life
You're perfect
I do, yeah, I do, yeah
You think that I don't notice
How you brush your hair out of your green eyes
The way you blush when you drink red wine
The way you smile when you try to bend the truth
You think that I don't notice
All the songs you sing underneath your breath
You still tear up at a beach sunset
And you dance just like you're the only the in the room
You think that I don't notice, but I do
I do, yeah, I do, yeah
