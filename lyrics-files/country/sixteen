Sixteen by Thomas Rhett

life changes

Take a left here boy, take it slow
Don't get distracted by that radio
I just rolled my eyes and I said, "Daddy, I know
I'm fifteen, I ain't green like some ol' ten year old"
What I wouldn't give to be sixteen, wild and free
Cruisin' up and down Main in my F-150
Roll the windows down, bass too loud from this burnt CD
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm sixteen, sixteen
Sixteen, yeah
Now that I can drive, finally feel alive, but I got this curfew
Sneakin' in late, smelling like my girlfriend's perfume
People talk about college and knowledge and that's alright
But all I'm thinkin' 'bout is an unsupervised Saturday night
What I wouldn't give to be eighteen, wild and free
Buzzin' off a can of the Grizzly Wintergreen
Lookin' old enough to pull off this fake ID
I'll be right where I wanna be
When I'm eighteen, eighteen
Eighteen, yeah
I'm old enough to smoke
I'm old enough to vote
But they turn me away when I go to the Cotton Eyed Joe
They say the grass is always greener
And I believe that's right
But my friends are off to Vegas, they're leavin' me behind
What I wouldn't give to be twenty one, wild and free
Open up a cold one and drink it legally
Chase a bunch of girls, go see the world
Let my wild streak run
I'll be right where I wanna be
When I'm twenty one, twenty one
Woah, when I'm twenty one
Yeah, when I'm twenty one, it'll be alright
Yeah, it'll be alright, when I'm twenty one
Now I'm twenty five and I'm drinking wine with my wife at home
Got a couple of dogs and a couple of songs on the radio
And we sit around and we laugh about how we used to be
When all we cared about was turning sixteen
