Speechless by Dan and Shay
Dan and Shay
speechless

You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume
Is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothing new
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes
I'm speechless
Staring at you, standing there in that dress
What it's doing to me, ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we meet
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words out of my mouth without even trying
And I'm speechless
Staring at you, standing there in that dress
What it's doing to me, ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes
I'm speechless
You're standing there in that dress
Girl it ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do, oh
I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
Oh, you know it, baby
Oh oh, mmm
