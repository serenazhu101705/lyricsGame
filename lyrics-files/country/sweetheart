Sweetheart by Thomas Rhett

life changes

Sweetheart
God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woke up this morning, to your sleepy smile
I realized I haven't told you in a while
That you're my life, you're my dream
You're the reason for every song I sing
You're my rock, you're my world
You're my always and forever girl
Sweetheart
God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart
One kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason, I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me
Yeah, you're sweet like chocolate
Hot like siracha
Yeah, girl you got me right in your back pocket
You're smooth like whiskey, fine like wine
I love how you're making my blood sugar rise
Sweetheart
God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart
One kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason, I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me
When the world gets cold
On those sleepless nights
Oh, girl you should know that you will always be mine
Sweetheart
God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart
One kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason, I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me
Ooh yeah, you gave your sweet heart to me
Ooh yeah, you gave your sweet heart to me, oh
