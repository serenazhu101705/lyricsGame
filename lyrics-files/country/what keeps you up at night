What Keeps You Up At Night by Dan and Shay
Dan and Shay
what keeps you up at night

Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night
You and me and these headlights
Engine idling in your drive
45 in a goodbye
I should probably get to going
Sun will rise before we know it
But, while the moon is still glowing
Let me leave a little taste on your lips
A little chill running under your skin
So, when it's a quarter past 3 still thinking 'bout me
Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night (yeah)
A little spray of my cologne
all over your pillows
Still feels like I'm so close
Let me leave my shape in your bed
Let me leave a little song in your head
Make you dance in the dark like you're still in my arms
Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night
Mmm, oh, wanna be, I wanna be, yeah
So when you're wide awake
And I'm the only thing on your brain
Just call and I'll be there to fall right in your sheets
Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning, like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss you 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be, what keeps you up at night
