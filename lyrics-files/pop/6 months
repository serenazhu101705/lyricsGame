6 months

Ehh, ohh
Feels like it's been 6 months and 7 days
When I'm without you, there ain't no way I don't think about you, yeah
All I do is think about you, yeah
I love when you get so shy that your cheeks turn red
How I am the only guy inside your head
I'm thinking out loud, yeah I'm just thinking out loud, yeah
'Cause baby when we fall asleep, you know that you're safe with me
Baby this is all we need, we're where I believe we belong
Wish I didn't have to go, it's hard to leave you all alone, baby
Even when we're far from home, yeah we're right where we belong
(Yeah yeah, oh, oh, aah-ooh)
All the space between us, yeah, it all still hurts
I'm getting jealous of my own t-shirt the way it
Holds you yeah (yeah), I wish that i could hold you, yeah (yeah)
I haven't slept in 3 nights, yeah you're on my mind
Flippin' through photographs to pass the time
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, yeah I'm always thinkin' 'bout you, yeah
'Cause baby when we fall asleep
You know that you are safe with me
Baby this is all we need, and we're right where we belong
Wish I didn't have to go, it's hard to leave you all alone
Even when we're far from home, (Ooh-oh) yeah we're right where we belong
(Yeah baby) (How we)
(How we belong yeah)
We are where I believe we belong, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause baby, when we fall asleep
You know that you're safe with me, baby this is all we need
And we're right where we belong
Wish I didn't have to go
It's hard to leave you all alone
Even when we're far from home, yeah we're right where we belong
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl I really love you
Yeah we're right where we belong
Girl, I really love you, love you yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You know I will always love you
Yeah we're right where we belong
