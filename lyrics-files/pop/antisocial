no.6 collaborations

All you cool people, you better leave now
'Cause it's about to happen
Friday night and I'm ridin' solo (yeah)
When I touch down, keep it on the low-low (it's lit)
I don't mess with your energy (no)
No photos (yeah)
So antisocial, but I don't care (yeah)
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here (yeah, pop it)
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though (yeah, pop it, pop it)
Got my hat low, don't talk to me (straight up)
I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud, easin' my pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me
I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something
I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me
I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (straight up)
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me
I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something
I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me
I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night
I need room, I need room
Where you standin' way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes
When I zoom, when I zoom
Pass out, wake up by myself at right past noon, right past noon
Then I'm doomed
(Occupied and moving dolo)
(Yeah)
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues (drown)
Right before I leave, she give me more than just a, "Miss you" (yeah)
That thing got more back just like my engine, I can hit it (in the back)
Seen a vision in the boy then we committed
I've (it's lit) been lost, out inner space
You left me right in my place
I put you down on my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me
I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something
I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me
I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (straight up)
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me
I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something, on something
I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me
I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night
