Because I Had You by Shawn Mendes

I think it's time that I be honest
Should have told you not to go
Thought I knew just what I wanted
I didn't know myself at all
You're with somebody I can't be, yeah
But I can tell that you're happy
It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I could never do
Because I had
Because I had you
Hey, remember when I told you
That you and I, we'd go down in history together
And does your sister ask about me?
You and I, what we had, is it gone forever?
You're with somebody I can't be, yeah
But I can tell that you're happy
It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I could never do
Because I had
Because I had you
There's nothin', oh
There's nothin' left to lose
Because I had you, babe
There's nothin'
Nothin' that I could do
I wish I had you
I think It's time I finally meet somebody new
And tell myself that she's the one to get me through
And she might help me forget 
That loving her is something I just couldn't do
Because I had you
