Boyfriend by Selena Gomez

rare

I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut
Again and again
I want a boyfriend
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love
Again and again
I want a boyfriend
I been up all night
Pretty restlessly
Think I might know why (ah)
I've been doing just fine
But baby, that don't mean
That I'm feeling anti you and me
There's a difference between a want and a need
Some nights I just want more than me
I know that there's a fine line between
It's not what I need, but (yeah)
I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut
Again and again (yeah)
I want a boyfriend (uh-huh)
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love
Again and again
I want a boyfriend
I want a boyfriend
I could phone a friend, use a hotline or something
But that won't get the job done (uh-huh)
'Cause every time I try (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Every time they lie (uh-huh)
I get a little anti you and me
There's a difference between a want and a need
Some nights I just want more than me
I know that there's a fine line between
It's not what I need, but (ooh, ooh)
I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut
Again and again (yeah)
I want a boyfriend (uh-huh)
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love
Again and again
I want a boyfriend (ah, ay, yeah)
I want a boyfriend (ah, just wanna)
I want a (ah, yeah)
I want a boyfriend (ah, yeah)
