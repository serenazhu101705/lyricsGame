Dangerous Woman by Ariana Grande
Ariana Grande
dangerous woman

Oh, yeah
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business
God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused my mind is open
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothin' to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
Oh, yeah
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside (somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout)
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside (somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout)
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside (somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout)
somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
(Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy)
(Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy)
(Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy) somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you
