You gotta help me, I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feeling you wanna leave this all behind
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holding on
Aren't we?
No, they don't teach you this in school
Now my heart's breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever
All of the rumors, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Aren't we?
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever
Minibars, expensive cars, hotel rooms and new tattoos
The good champagne, and private planes
But they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I realize
That without you here life is just a lie
This is not the end
This is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh oh)
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history (oh oh)
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever
So don't let me go
So don't let me go
We can live forever
Baby, don't you know
Baby, don't you know
We can live forever
