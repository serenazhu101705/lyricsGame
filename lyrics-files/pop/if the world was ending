If the World was Ending by J.P Saxe

if the world was ending

I was distracted
And in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinking
Were you out drinking?
Were you in the living room watching television?
It's been a year now
Think I figured out how
How to let you go and let the communication die out
And I know, you know, we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
And I know, you know, we know we weren't made for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending you'd come over right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night?
Would you love me for the hell of it
And our fears would be irrelevant?
If the world was ending you'd come over right?
Sky be falling while I hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending you'd come over right?
Right?
If the world was ending you'd come over right?
Right
I tried to imagine
Your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinking
That night we went drinking
Stumbled though the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
Oh, it's been a year now
Think I figured out how
How to think about you without it ripping my heart out
And I know, you know, we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
And I know, you know, we know we weren't made for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending you'd come over right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night?
Would you love me for the hell of it
And our fears would be irrelevant?
If the world was ending you'd come over right?
Sky be falling while I hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending
You'd come over right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over right?
I know, you know, we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
And I know, you know, we know we weren't made for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending you'd come over right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night?
Would you love me for the hell of it
And our fears would be irrelevant?
If the world was ending you'd come over right?
Sky be falling while I hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending
You'd come over right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over right?
If the world was ending you'd come over right?
