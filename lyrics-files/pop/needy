Needy by Ariana Grande
Ariana Grande
thank u next

If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I'll react
But all I can say
Is at least I'll wait for you
Lately I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know
Is I need you close
And I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate but I don't give no thoughts
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far?
This far
And I can be needy
Way too needy
I can be needy
Tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy
So hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot (yeah)
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish (selfish)
But after all this damage I can't help it (help it)
But what you can trust, is I need your touch
I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate but I don't give no thoughts
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far?
This far
And I can be needy
Way too needy
I can be needy
Tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy
So hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed
