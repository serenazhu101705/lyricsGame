Particular Taste by Shawn Mendes
Shawn Mendes
n

She don't listen to a thing 'less it feels right
Only dances when it's Kanye
She can take you one-on-one if she feels like
You'll be begging her for mercy, mercy
Ooh, she'll take your name and number
Then she'll hit erase and walk away
But ooh, she's so specific when she's at my place
At my place
She's got particular taste, yeah
She's so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't waste time on conversations, no
She just goes right for the face, yeah
She's so particular
Never pickin' up her phone 'less it rings twice
Only answers with a question, mmm
And if I try to play it cool, it never goes right
Got me drownin', drownin', uh
Ooh, she'll take your name and number
Then she'll hit erase and walk away
But ooh, she's so specific when she's at my place
At my place
She's got particular taste, yeah
She's so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't waste time on conversations, no
She just goes right for the face, yeah
She's so particular
I'm so obsessed with her
Yeah, she's so particular
I'm so obsessed with her
Yeah, she's so particular
She's the best at get you thinkin' that she don't care
Knows exactly what she wants, uhh
Now she's runnin' all her fingers right through my hair
And it means that
She's got particular taste, yeah
She's so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't waste time on conversations, no
She just goes right for the face, yeah
She's so particular
I'm so obsessed with her
Yeah, she's so particular
She just goes, she, she's so particular
I'm so obsessed with her
She just goes
Yeah, she's got particular taste
