It's hard to believe you don't remember me at all
Am I hard to recognize?
You say, "nice to meet you" every time
Yeah and I made you laugh
I still remember what I said
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
You say, "nice to meet you" every time
I know we got a lot of mutual friends
Don't say my name, don't come up in your conversations
Yeah
Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me like I got nothing on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

Are you playing hard to get?
Or maybe you're not interested
I don't understand why everybody thinks you're sweet
'Cause I see the opposite
No, you're not so innocent
I see the way you're lookin' through me right now
To see if there's somebody cooler around
Yeah
Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
