Stupid Love by Dan and Shay
Dan and Shay
stupid love

You sure know how to pick them now, don't ya?
That job, that smile, that might kiss you goodnight
So, take it easy on me now, won't ya?
You know what just gets to me every time
Saying I ain't gonna call, then I call
Now I'm in a car, driving too fast, going too far
That stupid love
Just when I thought that I kicked that habit
You work a little midnight magic
And there I go again
Falling back in that stupid love, pulling me in like a boomerang
It's always the same damn thing
Can't get enough
'Nuff of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love
I hate the way I need ya when you're leaving
You come and go, you do just what you like, yeah
We break up just to make up
Slide your makeup off the counter
Going back and forth for hours
Baby, I ain't got the power
to fight this stupid love
Just when I thought that I kicked that habit
You work a little midnight magic
And there I go again
Falling back in that stupid love, pulling me in like a boomerang
It's always the same damn thing
Can't get enough
'Nuff of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love
That stupid love, love, love
That stupid love, love, love
Falling back in
That stupid love (hey)
Just when I thought that I kicked that habit (thought that I kicked that habit)
You work a little midnight magic (work that midnight magic)
And there I go again
Falling back in (oh) that stupid love (yeah)
Pulling me in like a boomerang (oh-oh)
It's always the same damn thing (damn thing)
Can't get enough
'Nuff of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love
Can't get enough, can't get enough
Need it too much, stupid love
Lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love
Oh-oh, yeah
Lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love
