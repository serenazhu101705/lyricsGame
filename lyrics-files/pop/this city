this city

I've been seeing lonely people in crowded rooms
Covering their old heartbreaks with new tattoos
It's all about smoke screens and cigarettes
Looking through low lights at silhouettes
But all I see is lonely people in crowded rooms
This city's gonna break my heart
This city's gonna love me then leave me alone
This city's got me chasing stars
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home
Am I getting closer to knowing where I belong?
This city's gonna break my heart
She's always gonna break your heart, oh
I remember mornings when my head didn't hurt
And I remember nights when art didn't feel like work
She wakes up at noon and she's out 'til three
She leaves her perfume all over me
But I remember mornings when my head didn't hurt
Oh, this city's gonna break my heart (it's gonna break my heart)
This city's gonna love me then leave me alone
This city's got me chasing stars (got me chasing stars)
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home (oh)
Am I getting closer to knowing where I belong?
This city's gonna break my heart
She's always gonna break your heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She got a hold on me
She got me wrapped 'round her finger
She got a hold on me
She got me wrapped 'round her finger
This city's gonna break my heart (oh, yeah)
This city's gonna love me then leave me alone (it's gonna love me then leave me alone)
This city's got me chasing stars (oh)
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home
Am I getting closer to knowing where I belong?
This city's gonna break my heart (hey, yeah)
She's always gonna break your heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
This city's gonna break my heart, hey
She's always gonna break your heart
