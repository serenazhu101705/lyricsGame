What a Man Gotta Do by Jonas Brothers
Jonas Brothers
what a man gotta do

Caught my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the earth or lose a fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws
I'm not tryna be your part time lover
Sign me up for that full time, I'm yours, all yours
So what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"
So what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you
You ain't tryna be wasting time
On stupid people in cheap lines, I'm sure, I'm sure
So I'd give a million dollars just for you to grab me by the collar
And I'll come build us, build us
I'm not tryna be your part-time lover
Sign me up for that full-time
I'm yours, I'm yours
So what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"
So what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
So what a man gotta do? (what a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do? (what a man gotta do, yeah?)
To be totally locked up by you (totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta say? (man gotta say?)
What a man gotta pray? (what a man gotta pray?)
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"
So what a man gotta do? (what a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you (totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta do? (hey, baby)
What a man gotta prove? (what a man gotta prove?)
To be totally locked up by you (totally locked up by you)
