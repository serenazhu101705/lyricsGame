Yeah
Ooh la la
By the pool we're singing "Bailando"
Two nights with a view, yeah
Keeping those blinds closed, yeah
She said I wanna find somebody by nightfall
Ooh na na, could it be ya
Baby, I like you
Oh, watching her move, I was lost in the rhythms
And she pulled me close by the look in her eyes
Don't know her name but I know that I need her
She said "Boy, you won't be lonely tonight"
She said "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Kiss me like your ex is in the room
Don't you be afraid of something new
If you play it right, you can be that someone
Yeah, that someone who
Won't leave me lonely tonight
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah
Ooh la la
Make a move, yeah, baby by last call
Full moon night with the lights off
Baby your eyes glow (yeah)
Don't know why, but I feel like I'ma go psycho (psycho)
Ooh la la
If it's cool, yeah, baby I'd like to
Oh, watching her move, I was lost in the rhythms
And she pulled me close by the look in her eyes
Don't know her name but I know that I need her
She said "Boy, you won't be lonely tonight"
She said "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Kiss me like your ex is in the room
Don't you be afraid of something new
If you play it right, you can be that someone
Yeah, that someone who
Won't leave me lonely tonight
Caliente, te pongo caliente (mmm)
No te de miedo vivir algo diferente (eh, eh)
Las ganas no se equivocan (equivocan)
Pon tu lengua en mi boca (eh)
Vive la vida loca, loca, loca, mmm
Toda la noche bailando contigo
Suave y salvaje como un animal (eh)
Yo sé que te gusta pero esto es prohibido
Yo me voy contigo, dame la señal
She said "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Kiss me like your ex is in the room
Don't you be afraid of something new
If you play it right, you can be that someone
Yeah, that someone who
Won't leave me lonely tonight
Ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ayy)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Tonight
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Someone who
You won't be lonely tonight
