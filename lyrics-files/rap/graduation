graduation

Oh-oh-oh, woah, woah
It's fire
Huh, as we go on, we remember
All the times we spent together (ooh, woah)
As our lives change (ooh, woah), from whatever
We will still be (we will still), friends forever
First off, to the girl in my math class I'm rich
And you broke, *****, I had the last laugh
And to the dumb ***** in my science lab
How'd it feel when we fought and you caught a jab?
Man, **** prom, **** the teacher that was always talkin' on the intercom
And **** the student that we thought was always gon' bring in a bomb
And all of the girls wild, them ******* was too foul
They all on my **** now
Huh, as we go on (as we go on), we remember (we remember)
All the times we (all the times), spent together (ooh, woah)
As our lives change (ooh, woah), from whatever
We will still be (we will still), friends forever
Um, information leaker, had a crush on one of my teachers
Used to fantasize makin' love with her behind the bleachers
And to all the people who ain't like me, I ain't like me either
Half my class was havin' kids, guess we had that jungle fever
Uh, I was waitin' for my graduation (uh-huh), growin' impatient (uh-huh)
What I didn't know was this grown-up world (this grown-up world)
Was just school in a blown-up world (this blown-up world)
There's still gossip, there's still drama, there's still problems
There's a right and there's a wrong
There's still people that I think won't love me 'til I'm gone
Low-key miss the days walkin' 'round in my school halls
But now I got a bigger job, the world screamin' my songs
Huh, as we go on (as we go on), we remember (we remember)
All the times we (all the times), spent together (we were close)
As our lives change (as we change), from whatever (from what we know)
We will still be (we will still), friends forever (enemies 'til the end)
Lauren is such a ***** (I know, right?)
I don't even understand why guys like her, she's not even cute
She's not even pretty
Have you seen how much makeup she wears?
And by the way she Facetunes her pictures so much (oh my God, you are so right)
I honestly think she bought her followers
She barely gets any likes anyway (um, she's honestly kinda sad)
And you wanna know the craziest part about all of it? (What?)
She doesn't even have any idea
Her boyfriend's been cheatin' on her this entire time (huh?)
