life is good

Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
****** swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
****** caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this **** too plush
Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapstake, huh?
****** gotta move off my release day, huh

I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her ****, it is what is it (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb ****
