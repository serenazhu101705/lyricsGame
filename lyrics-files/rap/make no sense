Buddah Blessed this beat
I feel like I'm Gucci Mane in 2006
All these diamonds, dancing on my ******* neck cost like four bricks
And the way that I be toting on that strap, don't make no sense
He a million dollar ***** but be posted in the bricks, ayy
It make no sense, yeah

Make no sense, yeah
Make no sense, nah-uh
Make no sense, ay ay YoungBoy

I could hit it, I could whip it
I could bag it, I could stash it
I could trap out like a ************
And you know me, *****, I just bought another .30 burner (.30 burner)
I whip too hard, so I got Ike and Meech, got Tina Turner (whippin' hard)
It don't make sense, I'm not alright, ***** I'll put you under
Ain't cut too much, I got that **** that make them tweak, like damn
Can't be in front the trap too much, the world know who I am (I am)
This **** ain't sweet, who close to me, I see them hatin' like damn
All I know, get that money, still gon' be the one to slay 'em
Like *****, uh

I feel like I'm Gucci Mane in 2006
All these diamonds, dancing on my ******* neck cost like four bricks
And the way that I be toting on that strap, don't make no sense
