no stylist

Ooh
Yeah, louder
Hey, hey
I'm in London, got my beat from London
Iced out (stylist), no stylist (stylist)
New Chanel, Saint Laurent, Gucci bag (huh, ha)
Lifestyle (stylist), no stylist (stylist)
Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, that's on you (ha)
Diamonds on my neck, frozen tears (tears)
Hoppin' out the jet, Lears (Lear)
Bad ******* gettin' wet, here
Yeah, don't call me 'til the checks clear (clear)
**** they talkin' 'bout? Fast talk, runnin' laps
Now I'm not playin' that ****
French Vanilla, sippin' on, Lear jets pickin' up
Hong Kong, Morocco, I'm here
No stylist
And I ain't playin' with these *******, they childish (ha)
Yeah, look around, they quiet
She said I ain't got no heart, ****** find it
Iced out (stylist), no stylist (stylist)
New Chanel, Saint Laurent, Gucci bag (huh, louder)
Lifestyle (stylist), no stylist (stylist)
Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, that's on you (ha)
Diamonds on my neck, frozen tears (tears)
Hoppin' out the jet, Lear (Lear)
Bad ******* gettin' wet, here
Yeah, don't call me 'til the checks clear (clear)
I got the game in a squeeze
Who disagree? I wanna see one of y'all run up a B
Yeah, two open seats, we flyin' at 7 and packed for the beach
Yeah, keepin' it G, I told her don't wear no 350s 'round me
Iced out, no stylist
No Chanel, Nike track, doin' road with some waps
And that's Capo in the back, and that's swole in the back
Don't need Gucci on my back, TV Gucci got my back
Don't know where y'all ****** at, I've been here, I've been back
In Delilah, word to Zack, I need action, that's a fact
Iced out, no stylist (stylist)
New Chanel, Saint Laurent, Gucci bag (huh, ha)
Lifestyle, no stylist
Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo, that's on you (ha)
Diamonds on my neck, frozen tears (tears)
Hoppin' out the jet, Lear (Lear)
